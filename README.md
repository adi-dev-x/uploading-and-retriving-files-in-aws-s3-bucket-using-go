<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

This project demonstrates how to upload and retrieve files from an AWS S3 bucket using Go. We will use the Echo framework for creating the APIs and the AWS SDK for Go to interact with S3. The project includes two main APIs: one for uploading files to S3 and another for retrieving them based on filename.
